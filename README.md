# TODO 
    * countdown
    * on contract
        * Rewards distribution weights need to be defined on the begining of the round and saved on the round state
            * Because, if we change the weigths, old rounds need to know their own weigths
        * Ticket price needs to be bound also to the round!
    * ParseInt is not sufficient for larger numbers, max is 2000+ SEFI
